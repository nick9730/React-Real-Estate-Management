React-Real-Estate-Management I built one appliaction with Vite+React+Typescript and Tailwind.

This site contains:

    Animation from framer-motion,
    Routers from React-Router-Dom,
    Fetching data from supabase,
    zod for the form-validation
    Usage of React-Query,
    Pagination by React-Query,
    Google Maps Api

The user could save the properties with any value such as (price,location,beds,baths & etc....). Also, the user could share the link of filters because i have used setSearchParams.In additional,the user could find the location of property in the google-maps.The user could create,delete and update any value such as (price,location,beds,baths & etc....) in order to user this value for filters and for saving.
